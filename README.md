# Ontario Housing Prices and Income Trends

This project analyses the change in the housing prices over time in the Southern Ontario region. Also analysed, is if there is any increase or decrease in the housing prices due to COVID-19.

Below are four questions which will be answered through the analysis:

1. How are housing prices changing over time? 
2. What are the housing price trends across different regions in Southern Ontario ( 2015 vs 2020)?
3. How has housing affordability changed over time?
4. How has housing prices been affected by COVID-19?


# Source of Dataset:

Housing Prices by Year and Area:
 * CREA - The Canadian Real Estate Association Website

   https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/income-statistics-gst-hst-statistics/individual-tax-statistics-area-itsa.html


# Data cleaning process involves the following steps:

* Housing prices data only had 8 rows containing missing (n/a) values.
* Very complete data source.
* Final housing data frame consisted of 1110 rows and 8 columns.
* Renamed column headers and dropped columns not needed for analysis.
  * Made the data more readable and easier to analyze.
  * Renamed the different Regions.
  * Split the date column into Year and Month.
* Formatted the final Housing Prices data frame.
  * Round benchmark prices to two decimal places.
  * Added dollar ($) signs for units and commas ( , ) for readability.
* Grouped Housing Prices data frame by Region and Year.

# Insights:

* Expect further increases in housing prices over  the next several years, across all regions analysed for Southern Ontario.
* Prices for two-storey housing are increasing faster than apartments. This trend is expected to continue due to land scarcity in populated regions.
* Housing prices and income are based on different factors and do not change at the same rate. Housing prices are expected to increase more compared to income.
  * Housing markets usually have excess demand = higher increase in prices.
  * Job markets usually have excess supply of labor = lower increase of wages.
* Housing Prices are currently increasing, even during COVID-19, however more time is needed to accurately analyse the effect of COVID-19 on housing prices.
